# About

---

I am a systems engineer with a specialty in devops and infrastructure-as-code.  I have a solid background in networking, storage, and electronics.  I have largely spent the last 10 years trying to figure out _how to better manage compute and storage infrastructure_.  This is where I document my learnings and reflect on the state of the art as a whole.
